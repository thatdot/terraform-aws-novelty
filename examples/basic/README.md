# Basic Example

Simplest deployment of Novelty on AWS ECS Fargate with minimal configuration.

## Prerequisites

- AWS CLI configured with credentials
- Terraform >= 1.5.0
- Default VPC in the target region
- Novelty Docker image pushed to your private ECR repository

## Usage

1. Create `terraform.tfvars`:

```hcl
container_image = ""
```

2. Deploy:

```bash
terraform init
terraform plan
terraform apply
```

After deployment, access Novelty at the URL shown in outputs:

```bash
terraform output url
```

## Cleanup

```bash
terraform destroy
```

## What Gets Created

- ECS Fargate cluster with Container Insights
- ECS service running 1 Novelty container (2 vCPU, 4 GB)
- Internet-facing Application Load Balancer (HTTP)
- Security groups for ALB and ECS tasks
- CloudWatch log group
- IAM roles for task execution

## Outputs
